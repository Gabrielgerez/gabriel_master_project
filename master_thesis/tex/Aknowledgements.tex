First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Luca Frediani for all the
assistance, knowledge and patience he has provided.

I would like to thank my co-supervisors Stig Rune Jensen and Magnar Bj√∏rgve
who were quick to help me whenever I needed assistance.

I would like to thank all the people of the MRCHem group for their welcoming attitude
and help throughout these past semesters.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their support throughout these years,
and Jeanette, who has supported me all the way.
