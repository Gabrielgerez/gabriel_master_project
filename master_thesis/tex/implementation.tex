\section{Software used}
The problem was first implemented in Vampyr %cite and get the right font
which is a python %
Then it was implemented in C++ using MRchem %cite and get the right font
Both implementations are identical, except for slight changes for
performance improvement, such as a KAIN accelerator, %cite and correct font
iterating through $V_r$ instead of $V_{tot}$ % more explanation on this in previous or this section
and keeping the potential from cycle to cycle
in the c++ version of the model.
