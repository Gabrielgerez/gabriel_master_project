\chapter{Implementation}
\section{PCM}
\subsection{Dielectric function}
From \cite{FossoTande:2013ka} the cavity was implemented as follows

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  Cavity = $C$\;
  $r_i$ = position of the center of the sphere\;
  $R_i$ = radius of sphere\;
  $s(r) = |r - r_i| - R_i$\;
  $\sigma =$ width of slope \;
  \
 \For{each sphere $C_i$ at point r}{
  $C_i =\frac{1}{2}(1 - \erf(\frac{s(r)}{\sigma}))$\;
  $C = C \cdot C_i$\;
 }
\end{algorithm}
This would give us 1 on the inside of the Cavity and zero everywhere else. We
construct the dielectric function as a combination of the permitivity of free
space $\varepsilon_0 = 1.0$, the dielectric constant of the dielectric continuum
$\varepsilon_{\infty}$, and the Cavity in either a linear or exponential way \cite{FossoTande:2013ka} (Equations
\ref{eq:lineareps} and \ref{eq:exponentialeps} respectivelly). The linear
dielectric function is as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon(r) = \varepsilon_0C(r) + \varepsilon_{\infty}(1 - C(r))\label{eq:lineareps}
\end{equation}

The exponential dielectric function is as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon(r) = \varepsilon_0\exp(\log(\frac{\varepsilon_{\infty}}{\varepsilon_0})(1 - C(r)))\label{eq:exponentialeps}
\end{equation}

They were simply added to the end of the implementation of C so as to change the output of the cavity.

\subsection{Differences and limitiations in implementations}

\section{Reaction potential}

\section{Software used}
The problem was first implemented in Vampyr %cite and get the right font
which is a python %
Then it was implemented in C++ using MRchem %cite and get the right font
Both implementations are identical, except for slight changes for
performance improvement, such as a KAIN accelerator, %cite and correct font
iterating through $V_r$ instead of $V_{tot}$ % more explanation on this in previous or this section
and keeping the potential from cycle to cycle
in the c++ version of the model.
