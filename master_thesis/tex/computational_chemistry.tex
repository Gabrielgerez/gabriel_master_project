\section{\ac{SE}}

Consider a one electron system (such as \ce{H} or \ce{He+}). The system can be
described by a wavefunction $\Psi$. This wavefunction, by definition, has all
information about the system, which can be extracted by solving the Eigenvalue
equation with a characteristic operator $\vartheta$ for an observable property
$ e $ to be extracted \cite{Cramer:2004}:
\begin{equation}
  \vartheta\Psi = e\Psi\label{eq:eigenequation}
\end{equation}

The information that is of most interest in computational chemistry is the total
energy of the system $ E $. The operator for the energy of the system is called
the Hamiltonian $H$. Plugging this into \ref{eq:eigenequation} yields the
\ac{SE} \cite{Cramer:2004, Jensen:2017}:
\begin{equation}
  H\Psi = E\Psi\label{eq:SE}
\end{equation}

The one electron system considered now (\ce{H}) contains an electron and a
nucleus, which are described using three dimensional coordinates $ x, y $ and
$ z $. The Hamiltonian contains terms for the kinetic $T$ and potential energy
$V$ contributions of both the nucleus $ N $ and the electron $ e $:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    H   &= T_N + T_e + V \\
    T_N &= -\frac{1}{2m_N}\nabla^2_N \\
    T_e &= -\frac{1}{2m_e}\nabla^2_e \\
    V   &= \frac{Z}{||\vec{r}_N - \vec{r}_e||}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Where the operator $ \nabla^2$ is the Laplacian
