\section{\ac{SE}}

Consider a one electron system (such as \ce{H} or \ce{He+}). The system can be
described by a wavefunction $\Psi$. This wavefunction, by definition, has all
information about the system, which can be extracted by solving the Eigenvalue
equation with a characteristic operator $\vartheta$ for an observable property
$ e $ to be extracted \cite{Cramer:2004}:
\begin{equation}
  \vartheta\Psi = e\Psi\label{eq:eigenequation}
\end{equation}

The information that is of most interest in computational chemistry is the total
energy of the system $ E $. The operator for the energy of the system is called
the Hamiltonian $H$ which contains terms for the kinetic $T$ and potential
energy $V$ of the system. Plugging this into \ref{eq:eigenequation} yields the
\ac{SE}:
\begin{equation}
  H\Psi = E\Psi\label{eq:SE}
\end{equation}
