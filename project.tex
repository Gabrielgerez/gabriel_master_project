\title{Combining the Polarizable Continuum Model with Multiresolution
  analysis: a cavity-free approach to solvent effects}

\author{Gabriel Adolfo Gerez}

\section{Introduction}

One of the research activities carried out at the \ac{TCG} consists in
the development and application of \ac{DFT} methods in combination of
\ac{MW}. The developed code, called \mrchem{} is able to perform calculation of
moleculatr energy and properties at the \ac{CBS} limit, with
predefined and guaranteed precision, in virtue of the properties of
\ac{MW}. In order to extend the applicability of the code, a desirable
feature is the inclusion of the solvent effect. That would allow to
extend the applicability of \mrchem{} to molecules surrounded by an
environment (generally a solvent), which is most often the case in
practical applications.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Multiwavelets}
The schrodinger equation for a system with more than two atoms is too complicated for an exact solution. In order to solve it we use several approximations so that we can reach as accurate a result as possible while mantaining reasonable computation time.
The \ac{BO} approximation lets us divide the equation into smaller parts. We can focus then on the electronic part of the problem.

\begin{equation}
H_e \Psi_e E_e \Psi_e
\end{equation}

 The electron wave-function must be determined to solve the equation. Given that it represents all the elctrons in the system one can see that it is too complicated to solve exactly. Basis sets help solve this type of problems. They give a relativelly good approximation to the elctronic wavefunction so computation of the whole problem can be done more effectivelly.
 

\ac{MW} basis have several properites that are useful when designing numerical solutions to partial differential equations. Some of these are orhtogonality of the wavelet spaces, vanishing moments
%check more on that
and locally adaptive representations of functions, where the grid can be refined to focus only on special places where it will refine furhter to reach the desired precision %remember sources please. 
this gives flexibility to the type of problems that can be solved by use of this method.


I will learn how to implement this method and make adjustments to my computations to refine them.

\subsection{Solvent effect}

The goal with theorethical chemistry is to simulate chemical processes with as good accuracy as possible (relative to experimental values). It is possible to compute a system of a molecule in vacuum to a relative accurate level. This is not sufficient as most processes in chemistry happen in solvents, specially reactions. If one is to simulater such systems the particle in a vacuum model is not enough, the solvent effect has to be taken into account.

One way would be to try and compute the energy of the molecules in question together with a big enough sample of the solvent moelcules surrounding it. This becomes quite heavy and is not feasible anymore, moreover, it is not certain that this would simulate the solvent effect accuratelly.

One of the used models it to make a solvent continuum. This mean to make an average of the interactions the solvent has as a whole and model it as a continuum. The next step is to put the molecule to be analyzed in this continuum. There are several ways to do this (MM/QM methods and different surface descriptions). The method i will be using at the start of this project is The interlocking spheres model.

The interlocking spheres model can be explained as creating spheres around the atoms of the molecule. The radii of the spheres are equal to the van der Waals radius of each atom. these spheres interlock with each other, hence the name of the model, and make a cavity where the continuum of the solvent can't be in. 
The cavity model I'm using in this project describes the cavity as having a value of 1 inside the cavity and 0 outside the cavity. The function describing the cavity is as follows.
The signed distance of an arbitrary point $r$ from the surface of the Interlocking-sphere surface with atom positions $r_i$ and \ac{vdw} radii $R_i$ is described by the following function
\begin{equation}
s_i(r) = \vert r - r_i\vert - R_i
\end{equation}
The sphere surrounding the ith atom is described by the following characteristic function.
\begin{equation}
C_i(r) = 1 - \Theta (s_i(r)) 
\end{equation}
Where $\Theta$ is the heavyside function, which returns 1 inside the cavity ($C$ in the function 3) 0 outside and $1/2$ in the surface. $\Theta$ is defined as a heavyside-like function that smoothly switches over a controllable shell width $\sigma$. This makes it easier to control the transition, so that it isn't as abrupt.
\begin{equation}
\Theta (s/\sigma) = \frac{1}{2} (1 + erf(s/\sigma))
\end{equation}
For an amount of atoms $N$ we can then describe the interlocking spheres with the following function.
\begin{equation}
C(r) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{N} 1 - C_i (r)
\end{equation}

This would describe the spheres around the atoms with a value of 1 inside and a value of 0 inside. What is needed to compute the solvent effect is the cavity describing the molecule in the solvent continuum with a value of $\epsilon_0$ (permitivity of free space with value 1.0) inside and a value of $\epsilon_\infty$ (dielectric constant of the solvent, ca. 80 for water). Using these constants and the cavity function $C$, the following dielectric function is computed.
\begin{equation}
\epsilon (r) = \epsilon_0 C(r) + \epsilon (1 - C(r))
\end{equation}


\subsection{Project goal}

I will provide \mrchem{} with the
framework to include environmental effect. Currently such a capability
is present in a separate branch of the code and shall be transferred
to the master branch to make it available for applications.

\subsection{Plan and milestones}

The master project will be divided into the following activities.

\subsubsection{Literature search and theoretical development}

To carry out the project successfully, I will acquire the relevant
background in the following topics: \acl{DFT}, \aclp{MW}, and \acl{DC}
methods.

\subsubsection{Python implementation}

I will implement the methods necessary for this project using Python. I will also assist in development of the 'vampyr' branch of MRCpp which will be merged with the main branch of the group later.

\subsubsection{C++ implementation}

\subsubsection{Variational formulation}

\subsubsection{Density-dependent cavity}

The cavity that is described by the interlocking spheres created by the position of the atoms and their Van der Waals radius. This will be developed such that this cavity can be represented by the electron density instead, thus making the cavity more dynamic to changes and forces acting on the molecule. This will give us a density dependent dielectric function.

\subsubsection{Molecular properties}
