\title{Combining the Polarizable Continuum Model with Multiresolution
  analysis: a cavity-free approach to solvent effects}

\author{Gabriel Adolfo Gerez}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

One of the research activities carried out at the \ac{TCG} consists in
the development and application of \ac{DFT} methods in combination of
\ac{MW}. The developed code, called \mrchem{} is able to perform calculation of
moleculatr energy and properties at the \ac{CBS} limit, with
predefined and guaranteed precision, in virtue of the properties of
\ac{MW}. In order to extend the applicability of the code, a desirable
feature is the inclusion of the solvent effect. That would allow to
extend the applicability of \mrchem{} to molecules surrounded by an
environment (generally a solvent), which is most often the case in
practical applications.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Multiwavelets}

\ac{MW} basis have several properites that are useful when designing numerical solutions to partial differential equations. Some of these are orhtogonality of the wavelet spaces, vanishing moments
%check more on that
and locally adaptive representations of functions, where the grid can be refined to focus only on special places where it will refine furhter to reach the desired precision %remember sources please. 

I will learn how to implement this method and make adjustments to my computations to refine them.

\subsection{Density Functional Theory}

\subsection{Solvent effect}

\subsection{Project goal}

I will provide \mrchem{} with the
framework to include environmental effect. Currently such a capability
is present in a separate branch of the code and shall be transferred
to the master branch to make it available for applications.

\subsection{Plan and milestones}

The master project will be divided into the following activities.

\subsubsection{Literature search and theoretical development}

To carry out the project successfully, I will acquire the relevant
background in the following topics: \acl{DFT}, \aclp{MW}, and \acl{DC}
methods.

\subsubsection{Python implementation}

I will implement the methods necessary for this project using Python. I will also assist in development of the 'vampyr' branch of MRCpp which will be merged with the main branch of the group later.

\subsubsection{C++ implementation}

\subsubsection{Variational formulation}

\subsubsection{Density-dependent cavity}

The cavity that is described by the interlocking spheres created by the position of the atoms and their Van der Waals radius. This will be developed such that this cavity can be represented by the electron density instead, thus making the cavity more dynamic to changes and forces acting on the molecule. This will give us a density dependent dielectric function.

\subsubsection{Molecular properties}

\subsection{Tools and Methods}

I will make use of stallo in some of my computations. I will also make use of the methods already implemented in the 'Vampyr' branch of 'MRCpp'.
